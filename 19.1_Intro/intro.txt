Flask is a web framework -> it lets us build web apps in Python;
    Frameworks are like libraries but beefier and more opinionated
Flasks main competitor in terms of Py frameworks is Django; 

Both include sets of funcs, classes, etc that help us:

    Define requests to respond to
    Handle requests, forms, cookies -> typically a dynamic HTML response

Web apps in general need to do the above and also:

    Connect to a database;
    Provide user log in / log out
    Cache pages for performance

NOTE We could do this without flask, but its a nightmare;
