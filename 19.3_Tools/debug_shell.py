# Flask debugger

# When we make bad requests we often see the interactive debugger;
# NOTE we can also add raise to our code.
# If we click on the interact button, we are prompted for the pin that's
# generated on server startup;

# Once we enter it, we get access to a console window in the our browser!

# Here we can simply call our variabls and funcs

# Python Debugger
# PDB is part of py's standard library:

# import pdb
# pdb.set_trace();

# We would remove this before making it public;
# PDB comes with the same methods as javascripts advanced debugger:
# step through,
# Check the handout for commands;
