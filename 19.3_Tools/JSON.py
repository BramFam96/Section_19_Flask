# All the routes we've made render templates 

# However, we can also respond with JSON;

# This will be vital for creating, and updating APIs, and other DBs;

# When we hit submit on our route we would intercept the input,
#prevent form default, turn the input into an ajax request, and send it to our own server

# The server then responds with JSON, and then our app appends this to our list;


# 1)
  # We return a string from our route:
    # return '{"name": "whiskey", "cute": "hella"}'
