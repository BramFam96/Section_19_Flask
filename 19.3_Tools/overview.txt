Flask Tools

  Unlike previous sections flask tools will be a grab bag of important features

Goals:
  Redirecting
  Flash messaging

  Debugging Flask errors from error page;
  Setting breakpoints with pdb;
  Returning JSON

Intro to redirecting:

  Often used for validation;
  Idea is to serve different pages, or messages based on first page header;
  Also used when we change urls and want current users to easily adjust

To redirect, the page header needs to contain the redirect status code, often 302;
It also needs to contain a new URL for the browser to re-request;
