Flask Tools

  Unlike previous sections flask tools will be a grab bag of important features

Goals:
  Redirecting
  Flash messaging

  Debugging Flask errors from error page;
  Setting breakpoints with pdb;
  Returning JSON

Intro to redirecting:

  Often used for validation;
  Idea is to serve different pages, or messages based on first page header;
  Also used when we change urls and want current users to easily adjust

To redirect, the page header needs to contain the redirect status code, often 302;
It also needs to contain a new URL for the browser to re-request;

Common pattern:
  
  User submits data through post request;
  User refreshes the page, and data is resubmitted;
  'Are you sure you want to resubmit data on the page' dialog pops on user side;

Solution:
    have our post requests return a redirect to the original get route:

Check app.py line 24 for more details;

Message Flashing:

Impermenant information, such as confirmation messages, that last only one page load.

import it from flask as flash;
  call it in our route: flash('quick confirmation');

Iterate through get_flashed_messages in our template;

We can also pass in identifiers;

Check app.py line 30 and base.html
